#### Student by day, programmer by night! 

<hr/>

I'm all about coding during the day and putting it into action at night. I sprinkle in a bit of netflix and anime to unwind. Oh, if you've got a sec, check out the [portfolio](https://ezzohamdan.github.io/Project-9) I whipped up in my spare time. I'll be grateful, really!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CSS preprocessor that probably no one would use lol.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TailwindCSS.
- ðŸŒŸ Have you ever come across a flamboyance? It's when you stumble upon a group of flamingos hanging out, pretty fancy, right?!
- âœ¨ Wanna chat? Feel free to hit me up! Whether it's about coding, sharing Netflix recommendations, or discussing the latest anime, I'm all ears. Let's connect and see where it takes us!
