## 👋 Hey! I am Ezzo <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=ezzohamdan&label=Profile%20views&color=000000&style=flat" />
### Student by day, programmer by night! 

I'm all about coding during the day and putting it into action at night. I sprinkle in a bit of netflix to unwind. Oh, if you've got a sec, check out the [portfolio](https://ezzohamdan.github.io/Project-9) I whipped up in my spare time. I'll be grateful, really!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Machine Learning.
- 🏆 Recently, I hit a new high with my GitHub Foundations certificate.
- 🔭 I founded a startup and I am giving it most of my time and knowledge.
- 🌟 Have you ever come across a flamboyance? It's when you stumble upon a group of flamingos hanging out, pretty fancy, huh?!
- ✨ Wanna chat? Feel free to hit me up! Whether it's about coding, sharing Netflix recommendations, or discussing the latest trends, I'm all ears. Let's connect and see where it takes us!

### 📈 Crucial Milestones:
- On January 1st, 2025, I was thrilled to deploy two of my projects on Vercel. Check out [DailyEcho](https://dailyecho.vercel.app/) & [BasicTodoApp](https://react-basic-todo-list-app.vercel.app/)!
- On February 2nd, 2025, I was summoned to present and defend my graduation project: [Uni-Archives](https://github.com/Uni-Archives).
