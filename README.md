#### Student by day, programmer by night! 

<hr/>

I'm all about coding during the day and putting it into action at night. I sprinkle in a bit of netflix and anime to unwind. Oh, and if you've got a sec, check out the [portfolio](https://ezzohamdan.github.io/Project-9) I whipped up in my spare time. I'll be grateful, really!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my first react project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TailwindCSS.
- ðŸŒŸ Have you ever come across a flamboyance? It's when you stumble upon a group of flamingos hanging out, pretty fancy, right?!
- âœ¨ Wanna chat? Feel free to hit me up! I'm always ready for new opportunities, connections, or just making new friends!
